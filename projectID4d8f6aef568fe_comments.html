<HTML><BODY>This work by Ferdinand Blumentritt is often referred to, but quite hard to find. It offers an overview of the various ethnic groups living in the Philippines about a century ago, and is mostly composed from various, mostly Spanish, sources. A lot of later (English language) books again are based on this study.

<p>Blumentritt, a teacher in Leitmeritz, Austria-Hungary (now Litom&#283;&#345;ice in the Czech Republic), was a close friend of the Philippine national hero José Rizal. Although he never visited the Philippines, for that reason he is probably better known in the Philippines than in his native country -- where he belonged to the Sudeten-German community, that was expelled after WWII. A long standing rumor is that he also translated Rizal's <i>Noli me Tangere</i> into German, but I have never been able to trace any information of a copy of this anywhere. More information on this subject will be most welcome.

<p>Two scans in the original scans by Google where unreadable, so I replaced them with photographs from a copy available in the rare-books department at my library. Since I am not allowed to scan in there, those photos came out a bit skewed, and didn't OCR very well. Please type those two pages (4 after splitting in columns) where needed.

<p>Have fun!</BODY></HTML>
